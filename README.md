CS185-Pinball
=============

The Pinball project repo. I've used the "Enable Meta" setting in Unity to allow version control (this basically creates a text file for each asset) which makes it really easy to see exactly what changed in between commits.

I also added a .gitignore file so that the cruft that Unity generates wouldn't get added to the repo. Now simply clone the repo to your project, and you should be good to go making changes. Make sure to Sync Branch to get the latest version of the project to work on before committing your new changes.

Once you pull the CS185-Pinball repository, open the "Pinball" project in unity, and open scene Level1.unity to work on our first level.

This should be fun, let's play pinball!
